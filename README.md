# Maze-Game
 Further development of OpenGL techniques learned from Flappy Bird project.

Note: this is still very, very much in development and at the mement the transition from non-batch-rendering to batch-rendering has not been completed, so the screen shows nothing. However, much of the OpenGL code is improved from the Flappy Bird project and development can be clearly seen from then.

The aim of this project is to be able to write c++ code semantically similar to that of p5.js without having to touch OpenGL.
